# Overview

Working through Okasaki's *Purely Functional Data Structures* [[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/purely-functional-data-structures?format=PB&isbn=9780521663502).

Most of the implementations are based on this, unless otherwise indicated.
For completeness, I will also try to implement some features that go beyond
the exercises (designed for Standard ML) in [[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/purely-functional-data-structures?format=PB&isbn=9780521663502), viz., `Functor` and `Foldable`
instances for binary trees.

Work in progress.
