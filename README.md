# Overview

Working through Okasaki's *Purely Functional Data Structures* [1].
Most of the implementations are based on [1], unless otherwise indicated.

For completeness, I will also try to implement some features that go beyond
the exercises (designed for Standard ML) in [1], viz., `Functor` and `Foldable`
instances for binary trees.

Work in progress.
